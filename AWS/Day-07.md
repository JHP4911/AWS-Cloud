# High Availability Architecture with AWS CLI

### The architecture includes-

- Webserver configured on EC2 Instance

- Document Root(/var/www/html) made persistent by mounting on EBS Block Device.

- Static objects used in code such as pictures stored in S3

- Setting up Content Delivery Network using CloudFront and using the origin domain as S3 bucket.

- Finally place the Cloud Front URL on the webapp code for security and low latency.
