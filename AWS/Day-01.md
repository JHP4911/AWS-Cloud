# Getting started with AWS

## Today I started with introduction to Cloud Computing and what are benefits of Cloud Computing. Also covered what are Availability Zones..

### What is Cloud Computing?
--> Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources. <br>
--> The companies that provide these resources are known as cloud providers. <br>
--> Some of the examples of cloud providers are Amazon (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft (Azure), Google (GCP) etc. <br>

### Why Cloud Computing?
--> Agility <br>
--> Maintenance <br>
--> Multitenancy <br>
--> Performance <br>
--> Security <br>
--> Availability and more.

### Availability Zones :
Availability zones (AZs) are isolated locations within data center regions from which public cloud services originate and operate. 
Regions are geographic locations in which public cloud service providers' data centers reside. <br>
<b> AWS currently has 81 AZ's </b>
