## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

### Today I started first service in AWS i.e., EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) 

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. 
Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many 
or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in 
requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic. 

You can refer to official documentation of EC2 : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html
